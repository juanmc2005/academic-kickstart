I am a **PhD student** at Université Paris-Saclay working at LIMSI. My research focuses mainly on **continual self-supervised representation learning** in neural networks applied to speech and natural language processing. My ultimate goal is to design machine learning systems that can learn throughout their lifetimes like humans do.

In my free time I enjoy learning foreign languages, reading good science fiction and sometimes playing the saxophone.
