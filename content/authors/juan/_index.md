I am a **PhD student** at Université Paris-Saclay working at LIMSI. My research focuses on **Continual Representation Learning** in neural networks applied to spoken and written language. My goal is to design systems that can learn throughout their lifetimes like humans do.

In my free time I enjoy learning foreign languages, reading good science fiction and playing the saxophone.
